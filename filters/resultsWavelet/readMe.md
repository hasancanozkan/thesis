# declaring names

the approximation images are named like approx_crack1 --> these are 'haar'
else the names indicates other waveletfamily. 
crack_1 indicated the chosen original image, which can be found in parent folder.
the names starting with Daniel show abviously the images obtained from Daniel's code. These are identical to the one's that 
I got from pywavelets library, therefore I add only one image to prove
